     Lookover and improving the factors that are associated with customer satisfaction is essential for the fame of the company.
 
 #### APPROACH:
 
     Using R we can perform the analysis by the following ways:
     
      * Datacleaning - It is the process like find out the outliers,missing values,duplicate and fill the missing values,removing outliers,removing
                   features with less or no importance       
     
      * Visualization - Using 'ggplot' we can create a plots and provides helpful commands to create complex plots from data in a data frame. 
     
      * Exploratory Data Analysis -  provides a better understanding of data set variables and the relationships between them.
                                  'dplyr' is a package for making data manipulation easier.
     
      * Feature selection -Identify those attributes that are and are not required to build an accurate model.                             
     
      * Building models -Logistic regression,Naive bayes,Random forest,XGboost  
     
      * Predict the models with test data
     
      * Checking the accuracy for the prediction


#### OBSERVATIONS:

      * Number of loyal customer is higher than disloyal.      
        
      * But for the loyal customer also dissatisfaction level is high.
